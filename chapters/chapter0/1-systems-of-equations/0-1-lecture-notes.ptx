			Systems and their solutions
		</title>
		<definition>
			<p> A <em>linear equation</em> in variables <m>x_1, \ldots, x_n</m> is an equation of the form <m>a_1x_1 + \cdots + a_nx_n = b</m>, where <m>a_1, \ldots, a_n, b</m> are constants.</p>
			<p> We will sometimes say that an equation is a linear equation if it can be easily rearranged into an equation of the form above.</p>
		</definition>
		<p> 
			We may choose any letters that we wish for our variables.  When we are working with an unknown number <m>n</m> of variables we often choose our variables to be <m>x_1, \ldots, x_n</m> or <m>y_1, \ldots, y_n</m>.  If we are working with only three variables we are more likely to choose the variables to be <m>x, y, z</m> rather than <m>x_1, x_2, x_3</m>.  Occasionally we will have reasons to use other letters. 
		</p>
		<example>
			<p>
				The following are examples of linear equations in the variables <m>x, y, z</m>:
				<ul>
					<li> <m>4x+\pi y-3z=1 </m> </li>
					<li> <m>x+z=0</m> </li>
					<li> <m>x=2+y+z</m> </li>
				</ul>
				Notice that the second equation is equivalent to <m>x+0y+z=0</m>, so we can consider this equation as either being in only the variables <m>x, z</m> or as being in the variables <m>x, y, z</m>; which one is intended will always be made clear from the context.  The third equation can be rewritten as <m>x-y-z=2</m>.
			</p>
		</example>
		<example>
			<p>
				The following equations in the variables <m>x, y, z</m> are <em>not</em> linear:
				<ul>
					<li> <m>xy+z=2</m> </li>
					<li> <m>x^2+y^2-z=0</m></li>
					<li> <m>\sin(x) + \cos(y) + \tan(z) = 3</m></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</example>
		<definition>
			<p>
				A <em> system of linear equations </em> is a finite collection of linear equations, all of which are in the same finite collection of variables.  The number of variables does not need to be the same as the number of equations.
			</p>
			<p>
				A <em> solution </em> to a system of linear equations is a choice of values for the variables that makes all of the equations true.
			</p>
		</definition>
		<example xml:id="ex-solve-substitution-1">
			<p> Here is a system of linear equations in the variables <m>x, y, z</m>:</p>
			<md>
				<mrow> x+y+z=2 </mrow>
				<mrow> x-y=0 </mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				The assignment <m>x=0, y=0, z=2</m> is one solution to this system of equations.  Another solution is <m>x=1, y=1, z=0</m>.  Yet another solution is <m>x=2, y=2, z=-2</m>.  The assignment <m>x=3, y=2, z=-3</m> is not a solution to this system.
			</p>
			<p> 
				If we re-write the second equation as <m>x=y</m> then we can substitute it into the first equation to get <me>2y+z=2</me>, which we can rearrange as <m>z=2-2y</m>.  Now if we choose any value for <m>y</m>, and then take <m>x=y</m> and <m>z=2-2y</m>, then the first equation becomes <m>y+y+(2-2y) = 2</m> and the second equation becomes <m>y-y=0</m>.  Both of these equations are true no matter what value we give to <m>y</m>.  Therefore this system has <em>infinitely many solutions</em>.  Even better, we know how to find all of the solutions: Pick any value at all for <m>y</m>, then choose <m>x=y</m> and <m>z = 2-2y</m>, and you will have a solution to this system; moreover, every solution to the system is of this form.
			</p>
		</example>

		<example xml:id="ex-solve-substitution-2">
			<p> Here is a system of linear equations in the variables <m>x, y</m>:</p>
			<md>
				<mrow> x+y=0 </mrow>
				<mrow> x-y=0 </mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				For this system the <em>only</em> solution is <m>x=0, y=0</m>.  One way to see this is to re-write the second equation as <m>x=y</m>.  We can then substitute this in to the first equation to obtain <m>y+y=0</m>, which means <m>y=0</m>.  Then plugging this back into <m>x=y</m> we get <m>x=0</m>.
			</p>
		</example>

		<example xml:id="ex-solve-substitution-3">
			<p> Here is a system of equations in variables <m>x_1, x_2, x_3</m>: </p>
			<md>
				<mrow> x_1+2x_2-x_3=0 </mrow>
				<mrow> x_3=1 </mrow>
				<mrow> x_1+2x_2 = 5 </mrow>
			</md>
			<p> This system has no solutions.  To see this, re-write the third equation as <m>x_1 = 5-2x_2</m>.  Now substitute that, together with <m>x_3 = 1</m>, into the first equation to get <me>5-2x_2+2x_2-1=0</me>.  Simplifying this equation gives us <me>4=0</me>, which is not true no matter what the values of <m>x_1, x_2, x_3</m> are. </p>
		</example>

			The method of solving systems by rearranging equations and substituting them into other equations (such as we did in <xref ref="ex-solve-substitution-1" />, <xref ref="ex-solve-substitution-2" /> and <xref ref="ex-solve-substitution-3" />) may already be familiar to you.  While it is effective for small systems like these ones, it very quickly becomes impractical as the number of variables and the number of equations increases.  We will see another, more efficient, method in <xref ref="sec-Elimination" />.
		</p>
		<p>
			So far we have seen that a system of linear equations may have infinitely many solutions, exactly one solution, or no solutions at all.  We will eventually see that these are all of the possibilities, but we will need to develop many new ideas before we are ready to explain why that is the case.

			Augmented matrices

		<p> You might have noticed that the letters we choose for the variables in our systems essentially make no difference to the equations.  For instance, the system
		<md>
			<mrow> x-3y=4 </mrow>
			<mrow> 2x+y=-2 </mrow>
		</md>
		is fundamentally the same as the system
		<md>
			<mrow> r-3t=4 </mrow>
			<mrow> 2r+t=-2 </mrow>
		</md>
		because the only difference between the two is the letters we chose for the variables.</p>
		<p> 
			In fact, the only important information about the system above is that in the first equation the first variable has coefficient <m>1</m>, the second variable has coefficient <m>-3</m>, and on the other side of the equals sign the constant is <m>4</m>, together with similar information for the second equation.  Thus the following array of numbers, known as an <em>augmented matrix</em>, contains all of the relevant information about the system of equations:
			<me>\matr{cc|c}{1 \amp -3 \amp 4 \\ 2 \amp 1 \amp -2}</me>.

				<mrow>\vdots</mrow>
				<mrow>a_{m,1}x_1 + a_{m,2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{m,n}x_n = b_m</mrow>

			<me>\matr{cccc|c}{a_{1,1} \amp a_{1, 2} \amp \cdots \amp a_{1,n} \amp b_1 \\ a_{2,1} \amp a_{2, 2} \amp \cdots \amp a_{2, n} \amp b_2 \\ \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \ddots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \\ a_{m,1} \amp a_{m,2} \amp \cdots \amp a_{m,n} \amp b_m}</me>.

			In the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations the part of the matrix to the left of the vertical bar is called the <em>coefficient matrix</em>.  In this part of the matrix the numbers are the coefficients of the variables, while the variables themselves are represented by the column positions.  Thus the numbers in the second column of the coefficient matrix represent the coefficients of the second variable of the system.  Notice that we do not write the variable letters in the matrix!
		</p>
		<p>
			On the right side of the vertical line we have the constants from the equations.  The vertical line itself represents the equals sign.
		</p>
		<example>
			<p>Consider this system of equations:</p>
			<md>
				<mrow>3x-5y+z=15</mrow>
				<mrow>x+y+z=0</mrow>
				<mrow>x+3z=-2</mrow>
				<mrow>y+17z=1</mrow>
				<mrow>5x+2z=1</mrow>
				<mrow>y=3</mrow>
			</md>
			<p> The augmented matrix associated to this system is:
			<me>\matr{ccc|c}{3 \amp -5 \amp 1 \amp 15 \\ 1 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\ 1 \amp 0 \amp 3 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 17 \amp 1 \\ 5 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 3}</me>.</p>
