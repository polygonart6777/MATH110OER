<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">So far we have considered vectors in the plane, \(\mathbb{R}^2\text{.}\)  In applications of linear algebra one often needs to work in higher dimensions for a variety of reasons.  First, the space around is is three-dimensional, so for physical applications we often work in \(\mathbb{R}^3\text{.}\)  Other applications of linear algebra think of a vector as a list of data (rather than as a geometric object), and so may need even higher dimensions.  For instance, if you are taking five courses this term, then when the term is over your grades for the term could be listed as a vector with \(5\) entries (that is, a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^5\)).</p>
